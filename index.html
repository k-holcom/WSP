			<h1>Hello, I'm Kimerlee</h1>
			<p>Hello! My name is Kimerlee Holcom, but most people just call me Kim. (Mainly because they either can't pronounce or spell my name.) I am currently a sophomore at Full Sail University in the Web Design and Development.</p>

			<p>I <b>greatly</b> enjoy coding. I find it amazing how I can take an idea and create it using nothing but symbols, words, and numbers to make something visually pleasing.</p>

			<h2>Header</h2>

			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>The target audience for this header could possibly be anyone from a couple looking for a wedding photographer to a little league team looking for their yearly pictures to be taken.</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>Anyone who would happen upon this site whether intentionally or searching for a photographer would be able to see if this photographer would be a good for for them by visiting the about page or even the services. In the about page, the photographer would talk about the type of photography they enjoy doing and their experience. In their services page, they would detail what services are available, as well as cost most times</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>In the design, the designer used the colors black and orange in the text in the header. The color orange can be used to show creativity, which in photography is a must. A photographer must think of different angles and how to get the best shot. Along with the orange used, the black shows elegance and power. This could be because the photographer wants people to know that they exude elegance in their photographs and are confident in their work.</p>

			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>The target audience for this site would be more of a high end clientele. Those who would be more apt for a face to face meeting.</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>The type of clients this company is trying to attract are more of an upscale nature. Therefore, the users of this site need to be able to see where their office is located, how to contact them in every form.</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>I feel the company is more toward higher-end clients by the crisp lines and toned down color scheme. Its not bright, its full of blacks, greys and whites. </p>
