			<h1>Hello, I'm Kimerlee</h1>
			<p>Hello! My name is Kimerlee Holcom, but most people just call me Kim. (Mainly because they either can't pronounce or spell my name.) I am currently a sophomore at Full Sail University in the Web Design and Development.</p>

			<p>I <b>greatly</b> enjoy coding. I find it amazing how I can take an idea and create it using nothing but symbols, words, and numbers to make something visually pleasing.</p>

	<section class="blog">
		<div class="blogHead" id="header">
			<h2>Header</h2>
			<img src="img/header.jpg" alt="J. Simson Photographer" />
		</div>
		<div class="blogPost">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>The target audience are homeowners. The average age range of homeowners who would be targeted is between 34 and 70. The users of the site would be within a 50 mile radius of the handy man. This would also be based on his specific skills (which were not listed on the template).</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>The client would like to have a site that is able to relay his skills and availability. He would want his clients to be able to contact him about his services, read about his business, and about his services. <br /><br />
			Users need a simple way to find if he is the right man for the job. Therefore, they need something that is straight-forward and able to find his services and ways to contact him. </p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>In the header, there are four main colors. First, there is the color black. I do not think that the designer for this site intended on there to be a meaning behind the color. The Orange in the header (under the active page link) is used to make the active page stand out and make sure the user knows which page they are on. They yellow that is in the logo shows optimism and to draw the user to the name.</p>

		<div class="blogHead" id="map">
			<h2>Fullscreen Map</h2>
			<img src="img/fullScreenMap.jpg" alt="Consulting Co. Contact Page" />
		</div>
		<div class="blogPost">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>The target Audience of a site that would use this component would be those between the ages of 18 and around 40 or 50. The locale of users would vary. Most users would be local within 50 miles, but the possibilities are really nationwide due to the ease of entering an address.</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>Client needs are simple. They need to allow their users to see where they are located. This is shown by the pointer, and when the pointer is clicked(not shown) a pop-up gives the company's information such as name, address, phone, and any other pertinent information.</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>This design places focus on the map itself. By taking up the entire width of the screen, it is saying to the user that the company's location is very important. Also by having the darker map, it has a sort of elegance or sophistication to it.</p>

	<section class="blog">
		<div class="blogHead" id="socialMedia">
			<h2>Social Media Links</h2>
			<img src="img/socialMedia.jpg" alt="Social Media Links" />
		</div>
		<div class="blogPost">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>Men and women between the ages of 18 and 49. There is no location specific to this component as with social media it can reach world-wide.</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>The client who wants this feature is wanting their "name" to be spread widely. Social Media has a tendency to be as good if not better than word of mouth. When one person follows, they post about it and other see it and it increases the Client's business.</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>The design of this is very good. First the color brings attention to the area. As a client you want users to be directed toward specific areas and with social media, word spreads like wild fire. Therefore a client would want this to grab the user's attention. This example does so with the bright color. The color green is the color that represents communication and being social. This is a perfect choice for linking to the company's social media accounts.</p>

		<div class="blogHead" id="mobileCTA">
			<h2>Mobile CTA</h2>
			<img src="img/mobileCTA.jpg" alt="UFO" />
		</div>
		<div class="blogPost">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>The majority of users would be mothers with children between the age of 4 to 18 within a 50 mile radius. Unless the user is willing to travel farther for the gym.</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>The Client wants to attract new customers by letting them know about the pros of starting gymnastics, and the differences in the different types.</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>The Mobile CTA is simple yet straight to the point. The blue background portrays that the gym is kind, trying to portray the truth and the devotion needed for gymnastics. The font used is a sans-serif font and this can be seen as the gym is wanting to portray a smooth, simple, and sleek appearance. Finally, the images of both acrobatic gymnastics and the lesser known rhythmic gymnastics. This ties in to the tag-line "Get to know everything about gymnastics".</p>

			<h2>Gallery</h2>
			<img src="img/gallery.jpg" alt="Gallery" />
		</div>
		<div class="blogPost">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>The majority of users would be mothers with children between the age of 4 to 18 within a 50 mile radius. Unless the user is willing to travel farther for the gym.</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>The Client needs for this component would be to show the different avenues for gymnastics there are different forms and different levels. From the very beginning all the way up to more advanced.</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>The design of this takes up the entire width of the screen. This shows the user that there are many different choices. Also, when the user hovers over an area (as shown in the second row second column) The image is shown with a grey overlay and a button that goes to an article or more information. This draws the users attention to what they are hovering over and allows them to have more control.</p>

		<div class="blogHead" id="footer">
			<h2>Footer</h2>
			<img src="img/footer.jpg" alt="GoodBytes Web Design" />
		</div>
		<div class="blogPost">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>This company is attempting to reach those between the ages of approx 25 to 45. These are the ages when people are more apt to create a company and need the services of a web designer.</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>Users need simplicity and for the developer to be straight forward with what is available and how they can be helped.</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>The footer is what most people think of when they think of a footer. They have the basic contact information (their email address). However, there where a few things that caught my eye. First of all, the way the developer put the email address. This is a way to grab people's attention. People are use to seeing the @ sign. However, they use [at] instead. Secondly, they pose a question to the user. They ask if they can help me.</p>

			<h2>News Feed</h2>

		</div>
		<div class="blogPost">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>The target audience here is dog owners between the ages of 24 and 75. The locale of the user is not important beyond the United States.</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>The client is wanting to keep the users up to date on the news/blogs that are written.<br />

			The User needs an area that is clean and neat and easily accessible.</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>They use a very simplistic approach to this. They have a icon that represents either the author or the topic of discussion. They then have the title and brief excerpt of the article. On the side, there is the date that the article was created so they know which article is new and with all of this information, they are able to choose the best article for them and read it.</p>

			<h2>About Section</h2>

		</div>
		<div class="blogPost">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>Patients and future patients within a 25 mile radius between the ages of 18 and 80.</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>Ability to explain who they are what what they are set out to do.<br/>
			The users want to be able to see information about the people who they will be trusting with their health and the health of their family's health.</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>This page is very elegant and well thought out. It is split into 3 sections. A version of the rule of thirds. In the first section they answer the question/statement "Who We Are". There is then a section that is dedicated to answering that. The next section has a brief history of the company. Finally they answer some questions that would arise when someone would ask "Why should we use your company?". This can be found under the "Why Us?" section.</p>

		<div class="blogHead" id="cta">
			<h2>CTA</h2>
			<img src="img/cta.jpg" alt="Triathalon Club" />
		</div>
		<div class="blogPost">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>Men and Women between the ages of 25 and 49 who are interested in training for triathalons.</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>Allow users to access coaches/materials to better their races.</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>In this CTA, it is a very simple look. The background image shows what they are trying to accomplish through the training they are promoting. Next, the use of san-serif font is more of a casual, sleek feel compared to serif font which seems to be more of an elegant look. Also, the text size grabs the reader's attention and the word choice promotes the concept that anyone can do it with the word "Easy".</p>

			<h2>Information Area</h2>
			<img src="img/information.jpg" alt="Information Area" />
		</div>
		<div class="blogPost">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>Men and women between the ages of 18 and 80.</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>The client wants to promote information in the four topic areas.<br />
				The Users want to be able to access information easily and know what they are searching for.</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>The checkered pattern helps to differentiate between each section. The use of orange can be interpreted as being productive which I believe is the idea of this component. They want the user to be productive while visiting their site. With the alternating of Dark Orange to Light Orange, they tell the user that this is a different part of the site.</p>
