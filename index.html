			<h1>Hello, I'm Kimerlee</h1>
			<p>Hello! My name is Kimerlee Holcom, but most people just call me Kim. (Mainly because they either can't pronounce or spell my name.) I am currently a sophomore at Full Sail University in the Web Design and Development.</p>

			<p>I <b>greatly</b> enjoy coding. I find it amazing how I can take an idea and create it using nothing but symbols, words, and numbers to make something visually pleasing.</p>

			<h2>Header</h2>
			<img src="img/header.jpg" alt="J. Simson Photographer" />
		</div>
		<div class="blogPost">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>The target audience for this header would be those 20 years old and older. The range of uses ranges from couples looking for a wedding photographer to a coach looking for someone to take pictures of their team. </p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>Anyone who would happen upon this site whether intentionally or searching for a photographer would be able to see if this photographer would be a good for for them by visiting the about page or even the services. In the about page, the photographer would talk about the type of photography they enjoy doing and their experience. In their services page, they would detail what services are available, as well as cost most times</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>In the design, the designer used the colors black and orange in the text in the header. The color orange can be used to show creativity, which in photography is a must. A photographer must think of different angles and how to get the best shot. Along with the orange used, the black shows elegance and power. This could be because the photographer wants people to know that they exude elegance in their photographs and are confident in their work.</p>

		<div class="blogPost">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>Those who are inquiring about web design or doing research about web designers.</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>Users need simplicity and for the developer to be straight forward with what is available and how they can be helped.</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>The footer is what most people think of when they think of a footer. They have the basic contact information (their email address). However, there where a few things that caught my eye. First of all, the way the developer put the email address. This is a way to grab people's attention. People are use to seeing the @ sign. However, they use [at] instead. Secondly, they pose a question to the user. They ask if they can help me.</p>

			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>The target audience here is dog owners and those who like dogs.</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>The client is wanting to keep the users up to date on the news/blogs that are written.</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>They use a very simplistic approach to this. They have a icon that represents either the author or the topic of discussion. They then have the title and brief excerpt of the article. On the side, there is the date that the article was created so they know which article is new and with all of this information, they are able to choose the best article for them and read it.</p>

			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>They are reaching out for patients and future patients</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>Ability to explain who they are what what they are set out to do.</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>This page is very elegant and well thought out. It is split into 3 sections. A version of the rule of thirds. In the first section they answer the question/statement "Who We Are". There is then a section that is dedicated to answering that. The next section has a brief history of the company. Finally they answer some questions that would arise when someone would ask "Why should we use your company?". This can be found under the "Why Us?" section.</p>

		<div class="blogPost">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>Runners and Athletes</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>Allow users to access coaches/materials to better their races.</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>In this CTA, it is a very simple look. The background image shows what they are trying to accomplish through the training they are promoting. Next, the use of san-serif font is more of a casual feel compared to serif font which seems to be more of the "fancy" look. Also, the text size grabs the reader's attention and the word choice promotes the concept that anyone can do it with the word "Easy".</p>
