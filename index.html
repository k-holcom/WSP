			<h1>Hello, I'm Kimerlee</h1>
			<p>Hello! My name is Kimerlee Holcom, but most people just call me Kim. (Mainly because they either can't pronounce or spell my name.) I am currently a sophomore at Full Sail University in the Web Design and Development.</p>

			<p>I <b>greatly</b> enjoy coding. I find it amazing how I can take an idea and create it using nothing but symbols, words, and numbers to make something visually pleasing.</p>

			<h2>Header</h2>
			<img src="img/header.jpg" alt="J. Simson Photographer" />
		</div>
		<div class="blogPost">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>The target audience for this header could possibly be anyone from a couple looking for a wedding photographer to a little league team looking for their yearly pictures to be taken.</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>Anyone who would happen upon this site whether intentionally or searching for a photographer would be able to see if this photographer would be a good for for them by visiting the about page or even the services. In the about page, the photographer would talk about the type of photography they enjoy doing and their experience. In their services page, they would detail what services are available, as well as cost most times</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>In the design, the designer used the colors black and orange in the text in the header. The color orange can be used to show creativity, which in photography is a must. A photographer must think of different angles and how to get the best shot. Along with the orange used, the black shows elegance and power. This could be because the photographer wants people to know that they exude elegance in their photographs and are confident in their work.</p>

			<h2>Contact Page</h2>
			<img src="img/contactPage.jpg" alt="Consulting Co. Contact Page" />
		</div>
		<div class="blogPost">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>The target audience for this site would be more of a high end clientele and business men and women. Those who would be more apt for a face to face meeting.</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>The type of clients this company is trying to attract are more of an upscale or business nature. Therefore, the users of this site need to be able to see where their office is located, how to contact them in every form.</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>I feel the company is more toward higher-end clients by the crisp lines and toned down color scheme. Its not bright, its full of blacks, greys and whites. Also, if one looks at the back image behind the form, there is what looks to be a business man. This would be an indication of the type of clientele the would like to attract.</p>

		<div class="blogHead" id="landing">
			<h2>Landing Page</h2>
			<img src="img/landing.jpg" alt="UFO" />
		</div>
		<div class="blogPost">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>The type of users this landing page is targeting is those who are interested in the unknown or what others would consider science fiction. They are interested in things like UFO, aliens, etc.</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>For this site the company has a countdown at the very top of their landing page that counts down to the conference that is going to be held. This allows its users to have information as soon as they log on so if that is all they are after, then they are able to see it.</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>This site does a very good job at laying out the different sections. At the top is the countdown to the conference. This gives their clients an exact time something is going to happen. Whether for a store its a sale, or in this case for some event happening.</p>

		<div class="blogHead" id="mobileCTA">
			<h2>Mobile CTA</h2>
			<img src="img/mobileCTA.jpg" alt="UFO" />
		</div>
		<div class="blogPost">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>The company is trying to get those who need consulting of any form. It seems to be geared toward new businesses and those who are starting out in a venture</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>Client needs something that is simple to understand yet informative. They may not need to know everything, so need to have a brief summary/beginning of an article.</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>This example I find very visually offensive. I say this because of use of all bright colors. The green background with the bright blue right on top makes my eyes hurt. I can understand the connotations they are trying to convey. By using the green, they are conveying self-reliance, and the blue represents trust and loyalty. </p>

		<div class="blogHead" id="support">
			<h2>Support Page</h2>
			<img src="img/support.jpg" alt="Blizzard/Battle.net Support Page" />
		</div>
		<div class="blogPost">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>The target audience for this page/site is online gamers. More specifically those who play the company's games.</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>The User should be able to either discover the answer via browsing through the game they are inquiring about's known issues. They are also able to contact support, help unlock an account/recover an account, or get in game support via a ticket system.</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>This site is very simplistic. This is imperative because of the nature of the page. If someone is frustrated with an ingame or out of game issue, they do not want to be even more distraught by having trouble navigating a website. The developers organized things very well which helps with the simplicity of the site. They have the games listed off to one side, and on the right hand side, the 3 main ways of getting help. Users are also able to search for problems which helps to cut down on time searching and reading through a possible endless list of options.</p>

		<div class="blogHead" id="footer">
			<h2>Footer</h2>
			<img src="img/footer.jpg" alt="GoodBytes Web Design" />
		</div>
		<div class="blogPost">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>Those who are inquiring about web design or doing research about web designers.</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>Users need simplicity and for the developer to be straight forward with what is available and how they can be helped.</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>The footer is what most people think of when they think of a footer. They have the basic contact information (their email address). However, there where a few things that caught my eye. First of all, the way the developer put the email address. This is a way to grab people's attention. People are use to seeing the @ sign. However, they use [at] instead. Secondly, they pose a question to the user. They ask if they can help me.</p>

			<h2>News Feed</h2>
			<img src="img/news.jpg" alt="American Kennel Club" />
		</div>
		<div class="blogPost">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>The target audience here is dog owners and those who like dogs.</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>The client is wanting to keep the users up to date on the news/blogs that are written.</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>They use a very simplistic approach to this. They have a icon that represents either the author or the topic of discussion. They then have the title and brief excerpt of the article. On the side, there is the date that the article was created so they know which article is new and with all of this information, they are able to choose the best article for them and read it.</p>

		<div class="blogHead" id="about">
			<h2>About Page</h2>
			<img src="img/about.jpg" alt="Medical Diagnostic Center" />
		</div>
		<div class="blogPost">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>They are reaching out for patients and future patients</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>Ability to explain who they are what what they are set out to do.</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>This page is very elegant and well thought out. It is split into 3 sections. A version of the rule of thirds. In the first section they answer the question/statement "Who We Are". There is then a section that is dedicated to answering that. The next section has a brief history of the company. Finally they answer some questions that would arise when someone would ask "Why should we use your company?". This can be found under the "Why Us?" section.</p>

		<div class="blogPost">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>Runners and Athletes</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>Allow users to access coaches/materials to better their races.</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>In this CTA, they use the color red to draw the attention to the area. They then use an image of runners and claim to have an "Easy Start!"</p>

			<h2>Splash Page</h2>
			<img src="img/splash.jpg" alt="Chore Monster" />
		</div>
		<div class="blogPost">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>Parents and Children</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>It looks to be a place where parents and kids can create an area that would help encourage chores.</p>

			<h3>Design Critique</h3>
			<p>This design is very inviting for younger children and parents of younger children. It looks as if there is a place for Kids to click and a place for parents. There is also a CTA involved because they are asking the parents to sign up for the beta version. </p>
